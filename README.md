# üß† 8-Bit Microprocessor Project (Pipelined + Non-Pipelined)

Welcome to the repository for my custom-designed **8-bit microprocessor system**, featuring both **single-cycle** and **pipelined** architectures. This project showcases my end-to-end implementation of a RISC-style processor, assembler, and test programs, all designed in Verilog and simulated using Vivado.
